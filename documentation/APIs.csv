PRODUCT_LOCATION_ID,Accessions array,1 array of accessions,"1 array of concatenated product names, id and location",SQL,Done
SEARCH_RESULTS,"2 arrays; 1 accessions array, 1 array with each value = concatenated id, product and location.",2 arrays,"1 hash: keys: list of accessions and values: list of corresponding concatenated geneID, Product name and chromosome location",Connects the 2 sql queries above,Done
DNA_SEQUENCE,Accession clicked,1 string (The clicked accession),1 string of complete DNA sequence,SQL,DOne
PROTEIN_SEQUENCE,Accession clicked,1 string (The clicked accession),1 string of complete protein sequence,SQL,Done
EXONS_POSITIONS,Accession clicked,1 string (The clicked accession),1 hash: keys: exon starts; values: exons length.,SQL query and exons length calculation (Diff. end - start).,Done
INTRON/EXON,Does not need a function,Does not need a function.,The front end can do this task with 2 lines of code by only having the full DNA sequence and an hash of exons position. We aleady have SQL fnctions retrieving those for the front end to use.  The front end just need to place tags around each exon subtring.,"This task can be completed by only giving the front end the full DNA sequence and an hash of exons positions/length; both retrievable with queries; all the front end needs is to know which sbstring within the main string to highligh; same we decided to do for the restriction sites task. Code for the front layer:                                                                 foreach my $key (keys %exons)   {
   substr($sequence, $key, $exons{$key}) = ""<div>"" . substr($sequence,    $key, $exons{$key} ) . ""</div>"";
}

print ""<p> $sequence </p>"";",Done
